Recipe Menu Card
This project is a visually appealing React application that displays a collection of recipe cards. Each card showcases a recipeâ€™s name, preparation and cook time, details (such as servings, difficulty, and type), and an image. The design features a pleasant blue and purple gradient background, modern card layouts, and smooth hover effects for an engaging user experience.
Perfect for learning React props, component composition, and stylish CSS layouts!
